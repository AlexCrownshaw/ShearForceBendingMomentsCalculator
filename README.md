# ShearForceBendingMomentsCalculator
Calculates Shear Forces and bending moments along a simply supported two dimensional beam of any length. 
User inputs the length of the beam, number of point forces, magnitude and location of point forces as well as
location of supports.
All locations are entered as a distnace from the left hand side of the beam.
The reaction forces at the supports are calculated assuming the beam is in equilibrium.

# Context
This is my first project in my learning of C++ and aslo my first repository in my learning of git/github. 
The project aims to automate concepts learnt from my statics module of my first year Aerospace Engineering degree.
Any feedback (C++ or git related) is very welcome. 

# Planned features
- Allow uniformily distributed forces to be inputted by the user and included in SF and BM calculations.
- Allow the user to input any number of supports.
- Produce SF and BM graphs for easy visualisation.
- Identify maximum SF and maximum BM.
